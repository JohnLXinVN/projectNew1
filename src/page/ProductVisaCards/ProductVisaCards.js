                headerContent1="What is a company expense card?"
                content1="A company expense card is a payment card used to make payments on behalf of a business. For example, a sales team employee may need to buy dinner with their company expense card at a client meeting. The payment is made for work using the card provided by the business and connected to a relevant bank account. This means the employee does not have to pay with their own money and wait for the company to reimburse them. And it means that the company gets immediate visibility over spend providing the card is linked to appropriate, comprehensive software. Some expense management solution providers, like Payhawk, also feature in-built, customisable workflows so businesses can control their spending and set limits and approvals."
                headerContent2="How do companies manage Payhawk corporate visa cards"
                content2="Companies of a certain size will seek to work with a spend management solution like Payhawk to manage their company debit and credit cards.
